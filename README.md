# Portfolio Management System

## Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for a Database Management System (DBMS) course project, aimed at developing a comprehensive Portfolio Management System. The project is divided into four phases, each building on the previous one to progressively develop and refine the system.

## Project Description

A Portfolio Management System is designed to help users manage their investment portfolios. This involves tracking various assets, monitoring performance, and making informed decisions based on data analysis. The system should provide functionalities like adding and removing assets, viewing portfolio performance, generating reports, and simulating different investment scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Asset Management**: Users can add, update, and remove various assets in their portfolio, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.
- **Performance Tracking**: The system tracks the performance of each asset and the overall portfolio, providing insights and analytics.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed reports on portfolio performance, asset allocation, and investment returns.
- **Simulation**: Simulates different investment scenarios to help users make informed decisions.
- **User Interface**: A command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction with the system.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into four phases, with each phase containing specific documents and deliverables.

### Phase 1

- **Requirements Document**: Outlines the initial requirements and objectives for the Portfolio Management System.
- **Schema Diagram**: Provides the initial database schema used for the project.
- **Solutions Document**: Contains solutions to initial problems and tasks defined for the first phase.

### Phase 2

- **Requirements Document**: Details the updated requirements and additional features to be implemented in the second phase.
- **ER Diagram**: The entity-relationship diagram representing the database schema, showing all entities, attributes, and relationships.
- **Solutions Document**: Includes solutions and implementations for the tasks and requirements defined in the second phase.

### Phase 3

- **Requirements Document**: Lists the further refined requirements and enhancements for the third phase.
- **Normalized Schema**: Snapshots of the relational model after conversion to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, with explanations for each stage.
- **Solutions Document**: Documents the solutions and progress made in the third phase.

### Phase 4

- **Group 38 Report**: A comprehensive report documenting the final implementation, challenges faced, and solutions devised by Group 38.
- **Video Link**: A link to the video explaining the final code implementation and showcasing the functionalities of the Portfolio Management System.
- **Phase 3 Document**: The documentation from Phase 3, included for reference and continuity.
- **Source Code**: Contains the Python scripts and SQL scripts for the final implementation of the system.
    - **CLI Script**: The command-line interface script for interacting with the system.
    - **Database Script**: The SQL script for setting up and managing the database.

## Detailed Description of Files

### Requirements Documents

Each phase includes a requirements document that outlines the objectives, functionalities, and deliverables for that phase. These documents are crucial for understanding the progression and evolution of the project.

### Schema Diagram (Phase 1)

The schema diagram in Phase 1 provides a visual representation of the initial database structure, including tables, relationships, and key constraints. This forms the foundation for the database design.

### ER Diagram (Phase 2)

The ER diagram for Phase 2 represents the database schema in more detail, showing all entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. This is essential for understanding the logical structure of the database.

### Normalized Schema (Phase 3)

Snapshots of the relational model after conversion to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, with explanations for each stage, are provided. These diagrams show the progression from the ER model to a fully normalized relational model, reducing redundancy and ensuring data integrity.

### Solutions Documents

The solutions documents for each phase provide detailed explanations of how the requirements and tasks were addressed. These include design decisions, implementation details, and any challenges encountered during the development process.

### Group 38 Report

This report encapsulates the final implementation details by Group 38, offering insights into the development process, challenges, solutions, and overall performance of the system.

### Video Link

A video link is provided to demonstrate the final code implementation and explain the functionalities of the Portfolio Management System. This video is an essential resource for understanding how the system works in practice.

### Source Code

The source code directory contains the scripts necessary for running the system. The CLI script allows users to interact with the system through a command-line interface, while the database script sets up the necessary database structure and operations.

## How to Use the Portfolio Management System

1. **Setup the Database**: Run the `DB_Script.sql` to set up the database structure.
2. **Run the CLI**: Use the `CLI.py` script to interact with the system. This script provides various commands for managing the portfolio, including adding assets, viewing performance, and generating reports.
3. **Watch the Video**: Refer to the provided video link for a detailed walkthrough of the system's functionalities and usage.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of the development of a Portfolio Management System, from initial requirements gathering to final implementation.
